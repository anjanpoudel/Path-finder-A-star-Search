# Path-finder-A-star-Search
In this project I have implimented A* search and Uniform Cost Search Algoritm for efficient path planning in terrian. The language used is Java

# Accomplishment
Main accompleshment of this project is how choice of data structure and algorthm depends on nature of problem. If there is option between speed and memory optimization, choose to optimize memory because if memory is not optimized program will not run at all but speed can be tuned after we have working program.
